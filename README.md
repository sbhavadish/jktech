## Project Overview

The Books Review Project is designed to provide a platform for users to:

- **Add, retrieve, update, and delete books.**
- **Write and manage reviews for each book.**
- **Generate book summaries and recommendations using the Ollama integration.**

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- **Docker**
- **Python 3.11 or later**
- **pip** for managing Python packages
- **Alembic** for database migrations
- **Tesseract OCR** for optical character recognition

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Ollama integration and project dependencies:

### 1. Install Ollama Without a GPU

Run the following command to start the Ollama service using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
```

### 2. Run the Ollama Model

Execute the following command to run the Llama3 model:

```bash
docker exec -it ollama ollama run llama3
```

### 3. Set Up the Python Environment

Create a virtual environment for the project:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On **Windows**:

  ```bash
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On **macOS/Linux**:

  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 4. Install Project Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Tesseract Installation

To install Tesseract OCR, follow these instructions based on your operating system:

### Windows

1. Download the Tesseract installer from [UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
2. Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.
3. Add Tesseract to your system PATH:

   - Search for "Environment Variables" in the Windows search bar.
   - Click on "Environment Variables".
   - In the "System variables" section, find the `Path` variable and click "Edit".
   - Add the path to the Tesseract installation (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`).
4. Verify the installation by running the following command in Command Prompt:

   ```bash
   tesseract --version
   ```
5. 

## Database Configuration

Ensure you have the following database configuration in your environment:

```plaintext
db_host=db.postgres.database.azure.com
db_port=5432
db_name=jktech
db_pwd=arxt%40123
db_usr=postgres
MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:arxt%%40123@db.postgres.database.azure.com:5432/jktech
```

## Security Configuration

Configure your application with the following settings:

```plaintext
secret_key="your_secret_key"
refresh_secret_key="your_refresh_secret_key"
algorithm="HS256"
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=1800
CHARACTER_LIMIT=4000  # This is an example limit; adjust based on your modelâ€™s capabilities
model='llama3.1'
```

## Database Migration

To handle database migrations using Alembic, you can use the following commands:

1. **Create Initial Migration**:

   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
   ```
2. **Add Migration for Book Model**:

   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add book"
   ```
3. **Apply Migrations**:

   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

## Running the Project

Start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

You can now access the application at:

- [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) - Main application
- [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) - Swagger documentation

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, use the following command:

```bash
pytest test/test_suite.py --run test
```

This will execute the test suite and display the results in your terminal.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can perform the following actions:

- **Manage Books**: Add new books, view existing books, update details, and delete books.
- **Write Reviews**: For each book, users can submit reviews and manage them accordingly.
- **Ollama Integration**: Utilize the Ollama API to generate summaries and recommendations based on user input.
